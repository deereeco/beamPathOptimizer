[] - when i select all components and hit the letter U, i get a notification that constraints were removed, but when i then select one
component and drag it, there are still a ton on constraints left. why is this? 


[X] - the 'path length constraints' are not working well and they can break things it seems. should we remove them to clean things up? i will
probably want to redo them in the future in a more careful way.


[w] - the optimization part of this is not working well and they can break things it seems. should we remove just the optimizer parts of this to clean things up? i will
probably want to redo them in the future in a more careful way.

[] - The button for Manage Wavelengths should have the text on it for Manage Wavelengths and  when clicked it should open up a menu and a list view of all the current Wavelengths  with a button to add more Wavelengths if the user wishes.  So the color chosen by the user should be clickable from a color palette.  The user is not going to know the hex code needed for a specific color.  The same thing happens with an image.  Also, the user should have the ability to change the transparency of that image.


[] -  When the user chooses a solid color background, the workspace color does not change.  It seems like the grid behind it is changing only in a specific location.  The grid behind it should stay the same, only the workspace color should be changing. I gave you a visual of what i see here: "\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\root\myClaudeBox\beamPathOptimizer\pictures to show claude"
[] -  For the workspace background settings, there should be an additional button that the user  can click to set the color back to default.

[] -  The grid settings should be moved to the top right corner of the middle canvas area with  the button that opens the menu for the user to change the grid settings.

[] - all items in the left pane should also be centered

[] - The angle range property for all components should be limited to 0 to 180 instead of 0 to 360.

[] -  The categories in left pane, namely navigation, beams, and zones, should be bigger texts and bold so that it's obvious to the user that these are the categories.

[] -  The information in the properties pane is hard to read.  Let's make it left aligned but make it so that the label and for each property is on one line (as much as possible).  For example, on the first line you would have name: and then the text box to the right of that.  And on the next line you would have type: Waveplate, then on the next line you would have position and to the right of that would be X and Y and their values. these x & Y values can be stacked on top of eachother but aligned to each other. the intent of all this is to be easy for the user to see quickly what is what and have all labels on the left of the pane, and each one having esentially its own row visually.
